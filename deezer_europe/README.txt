About the dataset:

A social network of Deezer users which was collected from the public API in March 2020. Nodes are Deezer users from European countries and edges are mutual follower relationships between them. The vertex features are extracted based on the artists liked by the users. The task related to the graph is binary node classification - one has to predict the gender of users. This target feature was derived from the name field for each user.

Statistics:

Nodes 28,281
Edges 92,752
Density 0.0001
Transitivity 0.0959
